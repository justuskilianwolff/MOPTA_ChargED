This interactive interface is designed to allow stakeholders to run different scenarios, visualize results, and make infrastructure decisions.

You can navigate between pages in the side bar on the left. You are currently on the 'Home' page. Our report describing the problem set up, our modelling approach, and solutions is on the 'Documentation' page. To run our mode, go to the 'Optimize' page. 

On the 'Optimize' page, the sensitivity of different parameter settings, model configurations, and scenarios, can be further explored. You'll see a map of the given vehicle locations, or you can upload your own. Once the optimization run is complete, you can test the solution for robustness on new scenarios.

Thanks, and happy optimizing!
